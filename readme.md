# Example LIMS Connector Plugin
An example plugin for connecting Geneious Prime to a LIMS, ELN or registry system such that sequences can be submitted and retrieved. As
a demonstration, this just stores sequences in memory meaning the "LIMS" is wiped when Geneious is shutdown.

The plugin adds a "Submit" button to the toolbar for submitting sequences to a LIMS as well as a database service for
searching sequences in the LIMS.

This is designed to be used as a template for building real LIMS integration plugins. To do so, start by doing all the
`//todo`'s in the code and changing the variables in `build.gradle`. The main part is to implement your own `LimsAdapter`.

## Installation
From the root folder run the following command:

    ./gradlew createPlugin

This will create a gplugin under build/distributions which can be dragged into Geneious Prime
